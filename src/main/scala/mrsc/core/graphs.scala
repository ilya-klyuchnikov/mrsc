/*! # SC Graph Abstraction
 
 At the heart of MRSC is a mini-framework for manipulating SC graphs.
 In MRSC SC Graph is a special kind of graph that can be seen as a tree (skeleton), 
 some leaves of which can have loopbacks.
 Note that loopbacks can start only from leaves. 
 
 In some sense, SC Graph is similar to accessible
 pointed graphs (APGs) used in the theory of non-well-founded sets.
 
 Here is the simplest SC graph. There are two loopbacks: j⇢c and h⇢d. 
 There is also a concept of a path. The path to the node g is [0,0,1].

         . c
        .  ↓
      .    d
     .     ↓  .  
    .      e   . 
    .   ↙ ↓ ↘ .  
    .  f   g   h
     . ↓
       j
       
 SC graphs in MRSC are used in three forms:
 
 * `TGraph` - good for top-down traversals (a node knows about its outs).
 * `Graph` - good for easy bottom-up traversals (a node knows about in) and
 * for using in multi-result supercompilation 
    (graph consists of complete and incomplete parts, 
    and operation to add outs to incomplete nodes is cheap).
 
 The main idea here is to use functional (immutable) data structures in order to support
 multi-results composed of shared data.
