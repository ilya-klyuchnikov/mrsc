/*!# Equivalence and instance relations on configurations
  
  If the current configuration is `equivalent` to another configuration labeling
  an ancestor node, the supercompiler can loop back to that ancestor.
  (Looping back to arbitrary completed nodes is also possible if the operation
  `rollback` is not used, so that non-ancestor nodes cannot be pruned.)
  If the current configuration is an `instance` of another configuration
  the supercompiler may perform some actions in order to make looping
  back possible.
  
  At the semantic level a configuration c is regarded as a representation of set(c),
  a set of states of a computation process.
  It is assumed that
    (1) equiv(c1, c2) implies that set(c1) = set(c2);
    (2) instanceOf(c1, c2) implies set(c1) <= set(c2).
    
  Note that, `equiv` and `instanceOf` are supposed to be computable and total.
  On the other hand, the relations set(c1) = set(c2) and set(c1) <= set(c2) are,
  generally, not decidable. For this reason, in the general case,
  `equiv`  and `instanceOf` are not required to be transitive, and `instanceOf`
  is not required to be antisymmetric.
