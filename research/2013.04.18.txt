Tick operations.

What is done:
- Terms are adjusted with ticks. There is an option in residualizer to insert ticks.

Items to research/develop:
- Residual program with ticks stores information about cost model of original program,
  so during evaluation of residual program it is possible to calculate the number of ticks
  of execution of the original program.

Open questions/todos:
- Check correctness of operations with ticks during residualization. How do we substitute ticks?
  Especially, fully evaluated constructors with ticks.
- If residual program with ticks is correct, how should we evaluate it (with data) to get the same
  number of ticks as original program.
- Rigth now there is a falling test in TicksEvaluationSuite.
- What is very good, that it is very easy to write tests that check that our models are correct.

Parsers should be extended to handle ticks.
Substitution: Map[FVar, Term] => Map[Int, Term] (bad for testing renaming)
